# Working Notes â€” WarPigs Loot Manager

Purpose: Persistent, highâ€‘level notes to retain context as chat context expires. I will update this file as we make changes.

## Current State / Decisions

- App: Vite + React + TypeScript, Tailwind UI, shadcnâ€‘style primitives (Button, Input, Table, Card, Tooltip).
- Branding: "WarPigs Loot Manager" with dark theme and sticky top bar.
- Auth:
  - Gated app: unauthenticated â†’ AuthPage; authenticated but not approved â†’ PendingPage; approved â†’ app.
  - Logout hardened: tries `global` sign out, ignores `session_not_found`, then always performs `local` sign out and clears client state.
- Items Page UX:
  - Hero replaced with a 3â€‘step guide (Find â†’ Request â†’ Receive).
  - Live search filters items as you type.
  - Singleâ€‘column toggle: selecting an item shows a fullâ€‘width Item Manager; back button returns to list.
  - Mobile layout: card list on small screens; desktop keeps table.
  - Requested Qty shows a Tooltip listing unfulfilled requests in priority order (oldest first).
  - Leaders can inlineâ€‘edit item quantity directly in the list; autoâ€‘saves (400ms debounce) and on blur.
  - Quick-assign next to each request in Item Manager; leaders assign to a member with a tiny qty field + Assign button.
  - Right sidebar shows Recent Item Changes, Recent Assignments, and Latest Requests (added or increased quantities), each limited to 8 and sorted newest first.
  - Number inputs sized for two digits, centered text, native steppers kept; padding adjusted so steppers sit at the right edge.
- Data flow:
  - Assigning creates an `assignments` row, decrements `items.quantity` (onâ€‘hand), then decrements the source `request` by the assigned amount, deleting it when it reaches 0.
  - Requests list shows only unfulfilled demand; Summary tallies from assignments (unchanged).

## Roles & Permissions

- Roles: `member`, `item_manager`, `leader`.
- Item Manager: may add items and update item quantities (cannot delete items).
- Leader: all item manager permissions plus delete and admin controls.
- Enforcement:
  - UI: forms and inline edits are gated by `canManageItems` (leader or item manager).
  - DB: RLS policies allow item managers to insert/update items; delete remains leaderâ€‘only.

## Environment / Deploy

- Vercel (static): build `npm run build`, output `dist/`.
- Required env (all scopes): `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.

## Schema Snapshot

- `items(id, name, quantity, date_iso, created_at)` â€” quantity reflects onâ€‘hand stock.
- `requests(id, item_id, member_name, quantity, requester_id, created_at)` â€” unfulfilled demand only (decrement/delete on assign).
- `assignments(id, item_id, assignee_id, assignee_name, quantity, assigned_by, created_at)` â€” history of delivered loot.
- No `request_id` link on assignments yet (see TODOs).
- `settings(id=1, requests_enabled boolean)` â€” global toggle for request creation.

## Open TODOs / Followâ€‘ups

- Optional: Add `request_id uuid references requests(id)` to assignments for auditability and link quickâ€‘assign to the exact request.
- Optional: Postgres RPC to atomically (assign + decrement request + decrement item) to avoid race conditions.
- UI polish: row selection highlight; optional toast on quickâ€‘assign; refine header icons (ensure emoji render correctly in production).
- Branding: favicon / app icon update for "WP".
- Tests: unit tests for store logic (decrementRequest, addAssignment sideâ€‘effects) and tooltip rendering.
- Docs: README update for env setup and basic flows (leader vs member).

## Migrations

- We now track DB changes in `supabase/migrations/` with dated files.
- Latest: `2025-09-14_item_events.sql` — adds persistent audit of item additions and quantity increases with trigger and RLS for read.
- Apply missing migrations in Supabase SQL; snippets are idempotent and safe to reâ€‘run.

## Known Notes / Caveats

- Tooltip is portalâ€‘based and autoâ€‘flips above when thereâ€™s no space below; sorted by `createdAt` ascending.
- Inline qty edit uses optimistic debounce; failed updates revert and alert.
- If header emojis donâ€™t render correctly on Vercel, switch to small SVGs.
